## @deftypefn {Function File} {} fftfilt (@var{b}, @var{x}, @var{n})
##
## With two arguments, @code{fftfilt} filters @var{x} with the FIR filter
## @var{b} using the FFT.
##
## Given the optional third argument, @var{n}, @code{fftfilt} uses the
## overlap-add method to filter @var{x} with @var{b} using an N-point FFT.
