## @deftypefn {Function File} {} findstr (@var{s}, @var{t}, @var{overlap})
## Return the vector of all positions in the longer of the two strings
## @var{s} and @var{t} where an occurrence of the shorter of the two starts.
## If the optional argument @var{overlap} is nonzero, the returned vector
## can include overlapping positions (this is the default).  For example,
##
## @example
## findstr ("ababab", "a")
##      @result{} [ 1, 3, 5 ]
## findstr ("abababa", "aba", 0)
##      @result{} [ 1, 5 ]
## @end example
## @end deftypefn
